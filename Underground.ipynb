Olive oil cake with caramel oxen rosemary and olive oil gelato is just...unbelievable.We had to sit in the bar area, because we did not have a reservation, which was no problem. So better get a reservation even on weekdays. Food, ambient and staff were excellent!Best pizza in Boston from now on. Still can't believe you can get such a great pizza! Also try the olive oil ice cream.  Unbelievable.You can't go wrong with the classic Margherita Pizza!The food and service was great! The atmosphere is nice as well. The bar has outlets (not sure if they work but I saw outlets)Exquisite pizza and a great atmosphere for catching up with friends. Try the four cheese and goat cheese with truffle honey!Request to sit at the pizza bar to watch them cook. The pasta and pizza are awesome.The food is awesome. We did the \"sharing\" thing and we're thrilled with everything we ordered.Italian fried dough is a little salty but very delicious.  Their pizzas are top notch!Even if they are full on reservations, there is a good sized amount of bar top space.The food is great .. But they need to improve the service .. There eve excuse is they just opened 2 weeks agoitaly italian, NOT american italian.  small a la carte plates, so prices add upGrab a seat at the pizza barSweet pea agnolotti, amazing. Olive oil gelato, yums.Awesome pizzas in a festive environment. Great place near the courthouse.Fun spot. Bill can add up quick!!Decent food but service is subpar, still using the \"we've been open for only a month or two\" ...don't expect anything on time just yetget the margherita pizza!Service was very good, not like others reviews, but for the price, the food was not that special.Best Pizza in the town!The rigatoni pasta with eggplant was awful- pasta had no taste or flavor and they were not even cooked properly!!Best pizza in Boston!Meatball pizzaWe tried the goat cheese pistachio pizza with truffle honey and this was very good!!!\n",
      "Comes on Thursday for the summer season.\n",

      "The octopus was outstanding. Fennel sausage pizza & prosciutto pizzas were great. Really inventive gelato flavors the chocolate Lambrusco was to die for. Awesome wine on tap, all around a great place.I get a slice here at least once a week. One of the best Sicilian style slices you'll find in Boston. They have a few different kinds on weekdays, but 4 cheese is the way to go. Not cheap but so good.Pretty space and solid pizzas. Try the lemon pie, veal meatball or breakfast pie if you're there for brunch. Good craft beer selection and brunch entrees too if you're not in the mood for 'za.Pomodoro pizza is deceivingly simple—it's actually very spicy. Crust is flavorful and strikes a balance between crispy and gooey. Good selection of local beers on tap, but bar service was slooooow.great for groups (7) we walked in right as a group left and were seated promptly! fig+gorgonzola pizza is fun & tastyLove the veal meatball pizza. Good place to go for a large group and split some pizzas although a little over priced.Love the pizza and garlic knots, fun to go with a group.Gluten Free Pizza! We die! Don’t miss the Octopus, Pastoral Salad, & the Raw Vegetable Puccia!Atmosphere and service have been a little uneven both times I ate here. But the pizza is outstanding. They serve beers in tiny little glasses too which is weird.Went there after Row 34 wouldn't serve us after 10pm. Good food, good drinks, and bartender Mike gave us great recommendations.Solid craft beer selection. Get some Trillium on draft here if they have itPretty good pizza but horrendous value. I mean $18 for a pizza with a couple of piece of mozzarella and prosciutto? Give me a break.The fennel sausage knot is killer. Ask for a side of sauce with it though.The porcini pizza is fantastic and pairs great with the house pale ale.Grilled mozzarella,  all the artisan pizza s and lastly the freaking amazing fried olivesExcellent service. Very kid friendly. Get the duck sausage pizza.Prosciutto pizza with Arugula is really goodIt's a great late night eat. Just seat yourself and expect quick service from the host/server.Lemon pizza - great concept and worth a try!Excellent pizza, craft beer and great atmosphereGreat Pizza and get a Trillium if they have it on draft.First day.  Well done.  Yum.  #burntpizza #toastyFried olives, burrata, and Margarita DOC / Prosciutto pizza 👌🏻Slices of pizza, but only Monday through Friday, 11:30am to 3pmThe veal meatball pizza is one of the best pies in townThe salumi meatballs aren't to be missed!Pizza was excellent and the craft beer selection was quite good.Ask for a little well done - awesome pizzaOutsanding pizza and beer list. Bar staff is excellentPizza is amazing. And I'm from New York.Food is delicious, but our party was told a 25min wait time and wasn't seated until 90 min after our arrival.The bar has outlets and USB ports!Try the Diavolo pizza, spicy but good.Looks like a good place, but my single slice was just OK. Perhaps beware of premade slices that have been around all day...Pizza and veggies. Both world class.Looking for a quick bite/snack? Grab a pizza knot + a glass of 🍺/🍷My favorite is the margherita pizza🍕.Get the mezzi rigatoni (bolognese)Unless you're starving a pizza is definitely shareable.Very good pizzas, nice bar.Late night pizza! Serving until at least midnightGood meatballs!Food was good. Service was poor. The waitress had an attitude problem. I'm almost 40, do I not look old enough to be served a beer? Ridiculous!!Dig the vibeGet pizza. Other stuff is mediocre there\n",

      "The mushroom slice was solid and the service around the lunch break was quickGood for a quick slice! Broccoli chicken was really good!The pizza is excellent but the old man running it is a total dick who should not be allowed up front to deal with paying customers. He acts as if you are a bother, not money in his pocket.The slice was, but good value for MoneyOMG THE \"SAWSAGE\" PIE WAS SIIIICK WITH SOME TOMATO BASIL Soup...The best pizza in Boston, watch out for the surly waitresses! -Tania Peterson, Top Chef Just DessertsIf you love cold, greasy pizza served by a surly old man, you'll love this place.Pretty good pizza, but the guy at the counter is a complete ass!Возьмите кусок пиццы (который, кстати, огромен) и выходите наружу. Садитесь на ступеньки и наслаждайтесь.The pizza is good only when u get it fresh out the oven.Lovely pizza. A classic.BBQ Chicken Pizza was delicious! (but pricey!)Awesome pizzas!Best pizza around\n",
